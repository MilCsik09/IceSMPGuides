# IceSMP PlayerProfile platform

<!-- icesmp-doc-id: feature.platform.player_profile -->

## Canonical model

`PlayerProfileSnapshot` is the single logical aggregate for IceSMP-owned, restart-durable player state. It is immutable, Bukkit/YAML/SQL/HTTP independent and owner-bound by UUID. The root contains identity, lifecycle, onboarding, faction, economy, class-spec, professions, spellbook, talents, quests, companions, relics, achievements, statistics, preferences, social links, moderation and operations sections. Shared guild, party, market, claim, treasury, council, raid, season and audit-log aggregates remain separate and are referenced only by stable IDs.

## Storage boundary

Gameplay, commands, GUIs and APIs depend on `PlayerProfileRepository` and `PlayerProfileTransactionManager`, not YAML. `YamlPlayerProfileRepository` is the current adapter; a future SQL adapter must implement the same contracts. The class/spec model is `ClassSpecSection`; no independent ClassProfile aggregate or opaque ICS2 profile blob exists. Profile YAML files round-trip with literal keys on both read and write (SnakeYAML safe load/dump, duplicate keys rejected); Bukkit `YamlConfiguration` must not parse them, because it splits dotted extension keys into nested sections and silently breaks restart durability.

## Ledger-derived summaries and shared-goal splits

The shared punishment ledger (`moderation-data.yml`) stays the moderation audit authority; every ledger mutation re-derives the player's `ModerationSection` reference/summary (active punishment record IDs plus strike count) through `PlayerProfileModerationStore`, and the pre-login gate re-syncs it, so a failed publish self-heals. The weekly profession guild goal splits the same way: the week index and global counters stay a shared aggregate, while per-player contributions (`ProfessionSection.weeklyProgress` with a week marker), the per-week award marker and the pending reward XP live in the PROFESSIONS section — the award is idempotent per (player, week) over the durable owner enumeration, and the claim credits XP and clears the pending entry in one section commit. Daily budgets carry a per-budget reservation serial, so a delayed compensation can only revert the exact reservation it belongs to.

Crate settlements follow the fence-and-receipt shape: the shared crates file keeps only placements and opening-recovery fences, while per-player counts, cooldowns, the stored name and a bounded opening-id receipt list live in the STATISTICS section (`PlayerProfileCrateStore`). The profile commit happens before the fence is dropped, the in-memory `CrateLedger` is a load-time-seeded projection of the profile state, and an orphaned fence whose opening id is already receipted finalizes silently at the next load instead of double-counting. The death-to-respawn catalyst hand-back is a durable LIFECYCLE escrow (`PlayerProfileDeathEscrowStore`): the deposit commits before the respawn claim, and the claim empties the escrow in one section commit, so respawn, rejoin and crash recovery all deliver exactly once.

## Revisions and snapshots

Each section has schema and revision; the manifest carries global generation and the committed section revision map. Missing sections initialize with `-1 -> 0`; normal saves require `n -> n+1`. Full reads validate manifest generation before and after section loading, so snapshots are never an arbitrary time mixture.

## Transactions and recovery

Cross-section operations persist an owner-bound WAL and operation fingerprint, write prepared section files, atomically commit the manifest generation, close the operation receipt, apply runtime effects and clean temporary state. Restart before manifest commit rolls back; restart after commit finalizes. Duplicate operation IDs with a different fingerprint fail closed.

## Lifecycle and Folia

Join creates a session generation, recovers WALs, loads/initializes sections asynchronously, validates health, rebuilds derived mirrors, reconciles DARK/spells/companions, then marks the session ready. Quit fences mutations, drains transactions, flushes sections, cleans runtime and invalidates cache. Disable stops HTTP/admission, drains, flushes, cleans runtime and shuts executors down with a bounded timeout. Bukkit entity access remains in owner/region-thread adapters; YAML I/O is asynchronous.
