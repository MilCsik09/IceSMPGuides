# Runtime hardening audit — corrected scope, 2026-08-03/04

## Reported failures and actual root causes

- **Vanish did not hide the player at all:** `icesmp.moderation.vanish.see` was inherited by the OP/moderation/admin-all
  permission bundles. The usual admin testing `/vanish` was therefore always an observer exempt from hiding. In addition,
  entity tracking and the tab list were not treated as two separately owned visibility surfaces.
- **Normal claims were rectangle-only:** the player flow had only `pos1`/`pos2`, so it could not create the territory-style
  multi-point outline requested for ordinary claims.
- **The BlockDisplay glass wall floated above the claim and did not cover the full boundary/height:** four stretched slabs
  were anchored to the viewer's Y instead of the actual claimed volume.
- **DARK territory mobs could spawn in the air and die from falling:** ambient undead used one
  `getHighestBlockYAt()+1` result without a stable-floor, hazard or full body-clearance contract and without bounded retries.

## Corrected implementation

### Vanish

- `icesmp.moderation.vanish.see` is explicit-only (`PermissionDefault.FALSE`) and is not inherited by OP, the moderation
  bundle or `icesmp.admin.all`.
- Every non-observer viewer gets both `hidePlayer(plugin, subject)` for the in-world entity and
  `unlistPlayer(subject)` for the per-viewer player list.
- Separate ownership ledgers restore only IceSMP-owned `showPlayer`/`listPlayer` pairs when vanish ends or the plugin stops.
- Visibility is reasserted after viewer join, subject toggle, teleport, world change, respawn and a delayed tracking rebuild.
- Damage immunity remains an event capability; no persistent `Player#setInvulnerable` state is written.

### Territory-style normal claims

- Quick square and two-corner rectangle claims remain compatible.
- Ordinary claims now also support `point`, `undo`, `clearpoints`, `points`, `polygon` and a dedicated `polywand` flow.
- The immutable `ClaimShape` is an exact set of claimed X-Z columns and supports concave simple polygons.
- Membership, overlap, column pricing, territory checks, exact WorldGuard row spans, YAML persistence, chunk lookup,
  particle preview and BlockDisplay rendering all consume the same shape.
- Polygon area is bounded by `claims.area-max-columns`; the vertex count is unlimited by default (`claims.polygon-max-points: 0`), because the rasterized column set makes runtime checks independent of it.
- Rasterization uses budgeted row scanlines rather than scanning the full bounding rectangle. Perimeter length, continuous
  area and every produced column are checked before publication; long/thin hostile inputs fail closed.
- Malformed stored polygons are rejected and skipped instead of silently widening to their bounding rectangle.

### Exact bounded BlockDisplay boundary

- Every exact X-Z boundary column owns a separate vertical BlockDisplay segment.
- Each segment starts at the claim's inclusive `minY` and ends at its inclusive `maxY`.
- No display block is created below or above the actually claimed Y range.
- Rectangle and concave polygon boundaries use the same stored Y band.
- RegionScheduler ownership and per-player preview cleanup remain Folia-safe.

### Stable DARK territory spawning

- DARK ambient undead use the shared `resolveSafeStandingLocation` contract.
- The floor must be solid, occluding, non-gravity, non-liquid and non-hazardous; three body blocks must be passable.
- Candidates must still be inside the exact target territory and pass claim/region rules.
- Each mob receives at most `dark-undead.spawn-attempts-per-mob: 12` distinct attempts.
- No valid location means no spawn. There is no airborne or close fallback.

## Other completed hardening retained in this PR

- bounded world-event/invasion/boss spawn safety and reservations;
- transactional multi-admin config GUI with stale-write rejection;
- deterministic and atomic profession recipe reload, including removal of one exact fishing-rod duplicate;
- Java/YAML item-model validation against the manifest and checked-in resource pack;
- reversible DARK daylight/zombification capability lifecycle.

## Measured audit results

- Config schema scalar entries: **9594**
- GUI-displayed entries: **203**
- Intentionally file/command-only entries: **9391**
- Missing, stale or duplicate GUI entries: **0 / 0 / 0**
- Profession recipes: **437**, after removal of one proven exact duplicate
- Profession recipe key duplicates / semantic duplicates: **0 / 0**
- Used GUI/item models: **269**
- Manifest models / checked-in pack models: **298 / 298**
- Missing manifest / pack mappings: **0 / 0**

## Automated coverage

`RuntimeHardeningRegressionSuite` covers vanilla rectangle compatibility, concave polygon membership and wilderness notches,
exact overlap/boundaries, self-intersection and oversized-input rejection, bounded scanline and fail-closed persistence contracts,
entity plus tab-list vanish ownership, exact minY/maxY BlockDisplay clipping, restored vertical extension and stable DARK standing
locations with finite retries.

The full repository `check` also includes event-spawn safety, config transaction/coverage, profession recipe audit and all
previously registered regression suites.

## Post-merge claim persistence and display privacy follow-up — 2026-08-05/06

The merged runtime hardening was reviewed again from the actual `master` tree. The follow-up keeps the original 3D claim
behaviour and closes additional persistence and tracking gaps without changing claim pricing or shape semantics.

### Persistence guarantees

- World upper bounds are stored and restored as inclusive values (`getMaxHeight() - 1`).
- Legacy `world;chunkX;chunkZ` keys are structurally validated before conversion.
- Claims from the temporary X-Z-only format, where both Y fields are absent, retain protection by receiving the full known
  world-height band and emit an operator warning instead of silently becoming a `0..0` claim.
- A record containing exactly one of `min-y` or `max-y` is corrupted, not an X-Z-only record; it is rejected fail-closed
  instead of being silently widened to the full world height.
- Stored Y bounds are clamped to a loaded world's current legal range; reversed or fully out-of-world ranges fail closed.
- One malformed trusted-player UUID is isolated to that trust entry and cannot discard the enclosing claim.
- One malformed claim entry is isolated from the rest of `claims.yml` and cannot abort the complete claim load.

### Viewer-private display guarantees

- Viewer-specific BlockDisplays set `visibleByDefault=false` inside the spawn consumer before the entity enters normal
  client tracking.
- The selected viewer is revealed only through `Player#showEntity` on the viewer's own entity scheduler.
- The compatibility `showOnlyTo` path acquires the effect entity's own Folia scheduler before changing default visibility.
- A public viewer-scoped spawn API is available for new private effects so callers do not need post-spawn hiding.
- The aurora veil also uses this pre-tracking viewer-scoped spawn API and no longer becomes public before being hidden.
- `RuntimeHardeningRegressionSuite` asserts pre-tracking privacy, aurora usage and effect/viewer entity-scheduler ownership.

### Independent validation while hosted runners are unavailable

- The complete modified `DisplayFxUtil` source was compiled with Java 21 against signatures matching the official
  Paper/Folia 1.21.11 APIs used by the implementation.
- The official API contract confirms that non-default-visible entities require an explicit `showEntity` call and that
  entity work must use `Entity#getScheduler()` rather than a location-bound region scheduler.
- This focused compile is supplementary evidence only; the normal clean Gradle build, complete `check`, consistency gate
  and documentation inventory remain mandatory once GitHub-hosted jobs can start normally.

## Validation policy

- Claim Y restoration implementation commit: `33048fcc22a7ac5d845d74e01c2714b05e883815`.
- All implementation-only workflows, Python patch drivers and encoded payloads were removed before final validation.
- The scaffolding-free tree is required to pass `./gradlew clean check`, `scripts/validate_gui_icons.py` and
  `scripts/check_consistency.py`.
- Exact-head workflow links belong only in the pull-request description.
- No force push or merge is permitted.

## Manual staging checks still required

Automated tests cannot prove the following visual/client/integration behaviour:

1. two real clients verifying vanish in the world, tab list and production scoreboard/nametag plugin stack;
2. BlockDisplay wall alignment and exact minY/maxY termination on cliffs, steps, caves and uneven terrain;
3. polygon-wand UX and concave claim protection on a running Folia server;
4. DARK undead spawn behaviour across real chunk unload/reload and server restart;
5. WorldGuard integration with production regions and a full resource-pack client join.

## Restored original claim Y behaviour

- Claims are again bounded 3D volumes: exact rectangle/polygon X-Z shape plus inclusive `minY..maxY`.
- New quick claims use the player's Y; rectangle selections use the two Y values' midpoint; polygons use the first boundary point's Y.
- Packaged defaults remain the proven original values: `default-height: 20`, `default-depth: 20`.
- `/claim extend up|down` again expands by `y-extend-step: 5` for the original per-column burned cost.
- X-Z overlap stays exclusive, so vertically separated claims cannot be stacked over the same footprint.
- The BlockDisplay boundary is created only from `minY` through `maxY`; no wall exists at unclaimed Y levels.
